      <description>This is part 1 in a series of posts. In this series I am going to explain how I created a full-stack curry ordering app&amp;rsquo;. Yes, you heard that correctly. I built and deployed into production a curry ordering app that allows people to order curry online. The project was inspired by the lovely team over at #hardeepisyourcurry
I&amp;rsquo;m going to share how I did it in as much detail as possible, while highlighting the learning curves and problems that I faced along the way.</description>
