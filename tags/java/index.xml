      <description>Quarkus is a Java framework that is crazy fast, compiles to native code and has a dreamy developer experience. üòç I am in love
What you so excited about Well. Imagine Spring boot if it started up in a fraction of a second. Imagine if you could not have to worry about running your application on a JVM container.

      <description>Sharing dependencies between Spring Boot Microservices and projects with Maven for better code-reuse and clean design
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem You&amp;rsquo;re looking at microservices, but you realise you want to send an object from one service to the other. You write a class, and then you copy and paste it from the code of one service to the other &amp;hellip; üí° there must be a better way to do this. You&amp;rsquo;re a good engineer and you know that copying around this POJO is bad practice.</description>
