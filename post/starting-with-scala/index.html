<p>Scala is a functional programming langugage.</p>

<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve always shied away from functional programming languages. I&rsquo;ve done that becuase I always thought they were only really used by hard-core academic <em>computer scientists</em> to make themselves sound intelligent in front of others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found out recently there are some really fun and powerful things to be learned from functional languages, such as Scala. They&rsquo;re fast, good for asynchronous operations, have low latency and because of that they are becoming more prevelant and sought after to meet the real-time, low-latency demands of today.</p>

<p>ReactiveX, Observable and event-driven architectures are all important technologies and concepts we can&rsquo;t ignore - and they borrow from functional programming.</p>

<p><img src="http://reactivex.io/assets/Rx_Logo_S.png" alt="http://reactivex.io" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to learn more about functional languages and share what strikes me as interesting about them, as I try to pick them up.</p>

<h2 id="why-scala">Why Scala</h2>

<p>Not sure when it first surfaced or became popular - but before getting interested I think it&rsquo;s worth asking <strong>why?</strong></p>

<p>üßê &hellip; Well, I&rsquo;m still not entirely sure why - but am going to take a stab at it.</p>

<h3 id="scala-is-fast">Scala is Fast</h3>

<p>Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine - before you get your pitchfork out, just, let me explain. Applications running on the JVM are not slow. The JVM merely has a slow startup time. Execution of code once the JVM has fired up is relatively fast.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to not mistake an applications startup time as meaning that the technology or programming language it was written in is slow. Compared to bare-metal, it of-course doesn&rsquo;t compare, but studies do show Scala is faster than Go and Java.

<h3 id="scala-is-good-for-asynchronous-tasks">Scala is good for Asynchronous tasks</h3>

<p>Well, Scala has promises. We&rsquo;re familiar with promises from <strong>JavaScript</strong>. To recap, a promise is a placeholder object that&rsquo;s given to the caller of a function or operation that&rsquo;s not yet returned with the completed operation.</p>

<p>Think of a promise as being like a note with your order number on it that you get when you order a coffee in a caf√©. You&rsquo;re very seldom handed your order immediately, so while it&rsquo;s being made they give you a note. A note that <em>promises</em> that you&rsquo;ll be given your coffee when it&rsquo;s ready.</p>

<p>Promises and <em>futures</em> allow operations to happen asynchronously in a non-blocking way freeing the main thread to do something else. You see this on the web, a spinner loading icon will be rendered <strong>while</strong> the data is being fetched asynchronously. Without non-blocking asynchronous calls everything would freeze until it was loaded.</p>

<p>With Scala, since it&rsquo;s working on the back-end the asynchronus stuff happens when doing some database transactions, or making further requests to other services.</p>
