      <description>Scala is a functional programming langugage.
For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always shied away from functional programming languages. I&amp;rsquo;ve done that becuase I always thought they were only really used by hard-core academic computer scientists to make themselves sound intelligent in front of others.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found out recently there are some really fun and powerful things to be learned from functional languages, such as Scala. They&amp;rsquo;re fast, good for asynchronous operations, have low latency and because of that they are becoming more prevelant and sought after to meet the real-time, low-latency demands of today.</description>
